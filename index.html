          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
          got every penny's worth.

          " I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been
          looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
          amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
          found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
          weeks was the best-and most grueling-time of my life. Since completing
          the course, I've successfully switched careers, Working as a Software
          Engineer at a VR startup. "

          " Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
          needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
          programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
          The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were vere
          hands-on and I never had to wait long for particular, was outstanding.
          it took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could
          ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an
          example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job
          as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
          recommend! "
